    "section": "Course Description",
    "text": "Course Description\nSimulations from numerical and statistical models are a key tool used to quantify and represent our understanding of many different environmental systems, including but not limited to the climate, sea levels, air pollution, and the electric power system. Data analysis of environmental observations and model simulations is an integral part of developing and evaluating models used to 1) test our assumptions about environmental system dynamics; 2) develop new insights into environmental processes; and 3) project future environmental conditions and outcomes. This course will provide an overview of the use of generative probability models to understand data and examine hypotheses about data-generating processes. The goal is to provide students with a framework and an initial toolkit of methods for data analysis and simulation. Students will actively analyze and use real data from a variety of environmental systems. In particular, over the course of the semester, we will:\n\nconduct exploratory analyses of environmental datasets;\ndiscuss best practices for and complexities of data visualization;\ncalibrate statistical and process-based numerical models using environmental data;\nuse simulations from calibrated models to identify key sources of uncertainty and model error;\nassess model fit and adequacy through predictive ability."

    "section": "Course Description",
    "text": "Course Description\nOur journey will take us through a spectrum of climate-related themes, from scrutinizing historical hazard events in modern socio-economic contexts, to critically examining climate modeling and its unequal impacts. We’ll delve deep into various climate risks—flooding, drought, electric power system failures—all while focusing on the vulnerable and marginalized communities that these events disproportionately impact. The course’s pedagogical approach emphasizes the power of collaboration. Students from diverse backgrounds will find a platform where they can learn from and enrich each other’s understanding. CALS students will have the opportunity to apply engineering and ecological methods, while AAP students bring their spatial and design expertise to the table. In parallel, we will also navigate the politics of modeling, simulating, and visualizing climate realities, exploring how these tools can be deployed to not just predict, but challenge and disrupt the status quo.\nCentral to the course is the reinterpretation of ‘uncertainty.’ Rather than viewing it as a hindrance, we consider it as a catalyst to challenge conventional risk management paradigms, leading to innovative interventions and the envisioning of diverse futures, identities, and ways of being. The course leverages state-of-the-art tools, such as uncertainty, hydrodynamic and agent-based modeling, digital twins, and generative AI programming, offering students a multifaceted approach to confronting real-world climate challenges. Beyond the classroom, the course is enriched by a dedicated speaker series and site visits, facilitated through generous funding. As part of the larger The 2030 Project initiative, students will also have the opportunity to showcase their work to a broader audience through publications, exhibitions, and events, effectively bridging the gap between academia and society, theory and practice. Our objective goes beyond developing climate-aware professionals; we aim to cultivate proactive climate designers and engineers, ready to make a significant impact on our collective futures.\nKey Learning Objectives:\n\nAnalyze climate engineering challenges and design innovative hydrologic solutions using spatial and engineering skills.\nFoster interdisciplinary collaboration, integrating diverse design and engineering principles to develop problem-solving strategies.\nEnhance interoperability across modeling and simulation tools.\nEmbrace uncertainty to envision just climate futures."

    "text": "One near-to-medium-term effect of climate change is an increase in flooding hazard due to sea-level rise and changes in storm and precipitation patterns. Managing flooding hazards is complex due to feedbacks resulting from built infrastructure and human-system adaptations which can ameliorate or exacerbate the corresponding risks. We work on understanding how these feedbacks, and their associated uncertainties, influence both flooding risks and the efficacy of planned risk management interventions, including both “hard” infrastructure such as levees and “soft” adaptations such as zoning changes or relocation."

These investment strategies need to account for deep uncertainty and complex dynamics across sectors and between the natural and human systems. They affect stakeholders with diverse values and preferences, and have the potential to increase equity, resilience, and justice.\nOur research group focuses on the role of environmental and socioeconomic uncertainties in shaping the efficacy of climate risk management strategies. Our interdisciplinary, mission-oriented research addresses a broad set of problems, from flood risk management to energy-system investments and draws on tools from systems engineering, decision science, data science, and economics."

    "section": "",
    "text": "The relationship between the electric power system and environmental change is becoming more complex as energy systems continue to decarbonize and the broader economy is electrified. Future changes to environmental risks such as heat waves and flooding can reduce grid reliability while increasing demand. In addition to the natural variability of solar and wind resources, hydroclimatic variability may result in a weakening of hydropower as a zero-emissions generation source over decadal time scales. And California has seen blackouts resulting from attempts to manage wildfire risks by power utilities. We investigate the impact of these mechanisms under deep climate uncertainty for today’s decisions about energy system infrastructure investments. We quantify how climate variability and future climate changes impact power system reliability to understand how the power grid can be hardened to reduce outages."

    "text": "Course Description\nSimulations from numerical and statistical models are a key tool used to quantify and represent our understanding of many different environmental systems, including but not limited to the climate, sea levels, air pollution, and the electric power system. Data analysis of environmental observations and model simulations is an integral part of developing and evaluating models used to 1) test our assumptions about environmental system dynamics; 2) develop new insights into environmental processes; and 3) project future environmental conditions and outcomes. This course will provide an overview of the use of generative probability models to understand data and examine hypotheses about data-generating processes. The goal is to provide students with a framework and an initial toolkit of methods for data analysis and simulation. Students will actively analyze and use real data from a variety of environmental systems. In particular, over the course of the semester, we will:\n\nconduct exploratory analyses of environmental datasets;\ndiscuss best practices for and complexities of data visualization;\ncalibrate statistical and process-based numerical models using environmental data;\nuse simulations from calibrated models to identify key sources of uncertainty and model error;\nassess model fit and adequacy through predictive ability."
