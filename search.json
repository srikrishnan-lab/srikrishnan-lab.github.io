Lindsay Anderson)\n\n\n\nEnvironmental systems involve multiple interacting processes, uncertainties, and potentially conflicting objectives. These dynamics can complicate analyses which focus on a single component of the system, such as an individual pollution source, or a single outcome of interest. In this course, students will adopt a systems approach to environmental quality modeling and management, including applications in air and water pollution control and solid waste management. Students will learn to formulate mathematical systems models, translate them into computational models, and use these models for simulation of system dynamics and optimization of investment and management strategies. Students will be assessed using a combination of homework assignments, in-class computing labs, and in-class midterm exams. In addition, students will work on a group research project of their own design on an environmental systems topic of their choosing. At the end of the semester, students will submit a final report of their project along with a 10-minute video presentation. Students taking the graduate version of this course (BEE 5750) will complete additional homework problems to demonstrate additional mastery of the material.\nThis course is required for Environmental Engineering majors. While we will use the Julia programming language for computing, no prior experience with Julia is required.\n\n\n\n\nBEE 4850/5850: Environmental Data Analysis & Simulation\n\n\n\nSemesters Taught:\n\nSpring 2025\nSpring 2024\n\n\n\nSimulations from numerical and statistical models are a key tool used to quantify and represent our understanding of many different environmental systems, including but not limited to the climate, sea levels, air pollution, and the electric power system. Data analysis of environmental observations and model simulations is an integral part of developing and evaluating models used to 1) test our assumptions about environmental system dynamics; 2) develop new insights into environmental processes; and 3) project future environmental conditions and outcomes. This course will provide an overview of the use of generative probability models to understand data and examine hypotheses about data-generating processes. The goal is to provide students with a framework and an initial toolkit of methods for data analysis and simulation, including the specification of probability models, model fitting and simulation, and model evaluation and selection. Students will actively analyze and use real data from a variety of environmental systems. Students will be assessed using a combination of homework assignments, evaluations of topical readings, and in-class computing labs. In addition, students will work on a research project of their own design on an environmental data set of their choosing. At the end of the semester, students will submit a final report of their project along with a 10-minute in-class presentation.\n\n\n\n\nBEE 2000: Perspectives on the Climate Change Challenge\n\n\nSemesters Taught:\n\nSpring 2024 (with Christine Goodale, Angeline Pendergrass, and Jeremy Wallace)\n\n\n\nThis university-wide seminar series provides critically important perspectives on the grand challenge of climate change. Speakers from Cornell University and other institutions will cover a range of topics including the science of climate change, implications for ecosystems, oceans, forests, agriculture and communities, the important ethical, philosophical and legal insights on the issue, and provide thoughts on societal responses through international mechanisms, economic drivers and communication tools. Each week, students will be asked to write a brief essay summarizing and reflecting on the seminar.\nThis seminar series counts towards the requirements of the climate change minor and the ESS minor and major.\n\n\n\n\nARCH 7101: Climate Uncertainties\n\n\nSemesters Taught:\n\nFall 2023 (with Farzin Lofti-Jam)\n\n\n\nThis architecture design studio will explore a spectrum of climate-related themes, from scrutinizing historical hazard events in modern socio-economic contexts, to critically examining climate modeling and its unequal impacts. We’ll delve deep into various climate risks—-flooding, drought, electric power system failures—-all while focusing on the vulnerable and marginalized communities that these events disproportionately impact. The course’s pedagogical approach emphasizes the power of collaboration. In parallel, we will also navigate the politics of modeling, simulating, and visualizing climate realities, exploring how these tools can be deployed to not just predict, but challenge and disrupt the status quo.\nCentral to the course is the reinterpretation of ‘uncertainty.’ Rather than viewing it as a hindrance, we consider it as a catalyst to challenge conventional risk management paradigms, leading to innovative interventions and the envisioning of diverse futures, identities, and ways of being. The course leverages state-of-the-art tools, such as uncertainty, hydrodynamic and agent-based modeling, digital twins, and generative AI programming, offering students a multifaceted approach to confronting real-world climate challenges. Beyond the classroom, the course is enriched by a dedicated speaker series and site visits, facilitated through generous funding. As part of the larger The 2030 Project initiative, students will also have the opportunity to showcase their work to a broader audience through publications, exhibitions, and events, effectively bridging the gap between academia and society, theory and practice. Our objective goes beyond developing climate-aware professionals; we aim to cultivate proactive climate designers and engineers, ready to make a significant impact on our collective futures.\n\n\n\n\nBEE 6940: Climate Risk Analysis\n\n\nSemesters Taught:\n\nSpring 2023\n\n\n\nThe impacts of climate variability and change are subject to a number of deep and dynamic uncertainties which complicate systems design and management. Using coastal flood risk management as motivation, this course will introduce concepts and methods for uncertainty characterization and quantification for systems experiencing dynamic environmental risk and will explore implications of uncertainty for decision-making. Students will develop and apply these uncertainty and decision analyses in the context of several example systems."

    "text": "One near-to-medium-term effect of climate change is an increase in flooding hazard due to sea-level rise and changes in storm and precipitation patterns. Managing flooding hazards is complex due to feedbacks resulting from built infrastructure and human-system adaptations which can ameliorate or exacerbate the corresponding risks. We work on understanding how these feedbacks, and their associated uncertainties, influence both flooding risks and the efficacy of planned risk management interventions, including both “hard” infrastructure such as levees and “soft” adaptations such as zoning changes or relocation."

    "text": "Future climate risks are challenging to quantify due to their dependence on uncertain greenhouse gas emissions and Earth-system dynamics. We work on characterizing how risks such as sea-level rise and water shortages respond to socioeconomic changes (such as emissions pathways and economic growth) and their interactions with Earth-system uncertainties."

    "text": "Abstract\nIntegration of variable energy resources – e.g., solar, wind, and hydro – and end-use electrification increase modern energy systems’ weather-dependence. Identifying critical infrastructure constraining the power grid’s ability to meet electricity demand under weather-induced shocks and stressors is essential for understanding risks and guiding adaptation. We use transfer entropy to identify predictive pressure points: grid components whose utilization patterns provide early signals of downstream power shortages. We apply this method to simulations of New York State’s proposed future grid under various meteorological and technological scenarios, showing that pressure points often arise from complex, system-wide interactions between generation, transmission, and demand. While transfer entropy does not support conclusions about causality, the identified pressure points align with known bottlenecks and offer insight into failure pathways. Furthermore, these pressure points are not easily predicted by high-level scenario features alone, underscoring the need for holistic and adaptive approaches to reliability planning in power systems with intermittent resources."

    "text": "Abstract\nUncertainty in future carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions and the geophysical response to emissions drives variability in future sea-level rise (SLR). However, the relative contributions of emissions and geophysical dynamics (e.g. Antarctic Ice Sheet (AIS) tipping points) to future sea-level projections are not well understood. Here, we disentangle their relative importance by propagating an ensemble of CO2 emissions trajectories through a calibrated carbon cycle-climate-sea-level model chain. When neglecting negative emissions technologies (NETs), the CO2 emissions trajectory, particularly the timing of when emissions are reduced, becomes the primary driver of sea-level variability only after 2075. Accelerated AIS melting can greatly influence the transient sensitivity of GMSLR to cumulative emissions and warming. As a result of these path dependencies, delaying decarbonization reduces the “safe operating space” associated with the geophysical uncertainties. Our results highlight the importance of both adaptation and rapid decarbonization (including negative emissions) to manage the risks posed by SLR."

    "section": "Abstract",
    "text": "Abstract\nModels with high-dimensional parameter spaces are common in many applications. Global sensitivity analyses can provide insights on how uncertain inputs and interactions influence the outputs. Many sensitivity analysis methods face nontrivial challenges for computationally demanding models. Common approaches to tackle these challenges are to (i) use a computationally efficient emulator and (ii) to sample adaptively. However, these approaches still involve potentially large computational costs and approximation errors. Here we compare the results and computational costs of four existing global sensitivity analysis methods applied to a test problem. We sample different model evaluation time and numbers of model parameters. We find that the emulation and adaptive sampling approaches are faster than Sobol’ method for slow models. The Bayesian adaptive spline surface method is the fastest for most slow and high-dimensional models. Our results can guide the choice of a sensitivity analysis method under computational resources constraints."

While this simple model does not fully capture the behavior of the solar resource, an analysis of the posterior predictive distribution reveals strategies for improvement. A version of this model is also used to forecast both irradiance components for a 15-minute lead time while assimilating geostationary satellite data into an inhomogeneous transition probability specification. The inhomogeneous specifications produce sharper predictive distributions than an analogous homogeneous model, but all have similar skill relative to a smart persistence forecast."

As a transdisciplinary endeavor, the vision presented here should have elements that directly interest sectoral analysts engaged in energy, water, agriculture, transportation, health, etc. We hope these audiences will find the report a helpful reference and a source of opportunities for shaping the future of MSD science.\nThe report incorporates ideas and insights from the members of the recently established MSD Community of Practice (CoP). MSD finds its roots in a number of research fields and communities, including integrated assessment; impacts, adaptation, and vulnerability; Earth system science; and complex adaptive systems. However, the MSD CoP draws its conceptual basis from a 2016 workshop sponsored and led by the DOE, “Understanding Dynamics and Resilience in Complex Interdependent Systems: Prospects for a Multi-Model Framework and Community of Practice,” organized with other federal agencies and hosted by the US Global Change Research Program. The rationale for the CoP is that research on understanding risks and opportunities arising from tightly connected human and natural systems is fragmented across several fields, requiring improved collaboration and synthesis to accelerate needed scientific advances. A CoP Facilitation Team and a Scientific Steering Group (SSG) were launched in 2019 to advance the needed collaborations and scientific synthesis. Since that time, an initial core group of projects supported by DOE’s MSD research program has provided input to the development of the CoP through activities including a community questionnaire to identify current tools and research interests, regular meetings of technical working groups (WGs), MSD community briefings, research workshops, and the MSD CoP website."

The rationale for the CoP is that research on understanding risks and opportunities arising from tightly connected human and natural systems is fragmented across several fields, requiring improved collaboration and synthesis to accelerate needed scientific advances. A CoP Facilitation Team and a Scientific Steering Group (SSG) were launched in 2019 to advance the needed collaborations and scientific synthesis. Since that time, an initial core group of projects supported by DOE’s MSD research program has provided input to the development of the CoP through activities including a community questionnaire to identify current tools and research interests, regular meetings of technical working groups (WGs), MSD community briefings, research workshops, and the MSD CoP website."

    "text": "Abstract\nClimate change is worsening coastal hazards, elevating the need to mitigate and adapt to future warming and sea-level change. A key question is how future warming relates to coastal impacts in terms of adaptation costs and economic damages, and the potentially unequal distribution of these impacts globally. We use an integrated modeling framework to generate estimates of future coastal adaptation costs and damages, discounted through the year 2150, at multiple global warming thresholds. As warming crosses the 1.5 °C threshold, we find that high-end (95th percentile) coastal damages nearly double, from 1.3 T to 2.3 T US\\(. Beyond 2.5 °C warming, low-end (5th percentile) damages increase from 1.2 T to 1.6 T US\\) and the Global South faces disproportionately high damages as a percentage of regional GDP. Given the plausibility of 2.5 °C warming in even SSP2-4.5, these results highlight the importance of emissions reductions to avoid sizable and inequitable increases in coastal impacts."

    "text": "Abstract\nCoastal cities face increasing flood hazards due to climate change. Physical infrastructure, such as levees, are commonly used to reduce flood hazards. To effectively manage flood risks, it is important to understand the degree to which physical infrastructure changes both hazard and exposure. For example, many studies suggest that levee construction causes an overall increase in risk because levees promote exposure growth to a greater degree than they reduce flood hazards. Although this so-called “levee effect” is widely studied, there are knowledge gaps surrounding how uncertainties related to levee construction and flood risk translate into the occurrence and strength of the levee effect in coastal communities. Here, we use agent-based modeling to simulate the influence of flood risk information pathways on the dynamics around the levee effect, first under idealized conditions and then within a real-world coastal case study. We finally conduct a global sensitivity analysis to identify which model factors contribute to the strength of the levee effect. We find that, under idealized conditions, the strength of the levee effect is highly sensitive to economic (e.g., population growth) and engineering (e.g., levee failure) factors. However, under more complex coastal conditions, factors related to household behavior (e.g., risk aversion) are more influential on the strength of the levee effect. Overall, our findings emphasize the importance of capturing the interactions and uncertainties among multiple behavioral, economic, and engineering factors when measuring flood risk in coastal communities."

    "text": "Abstract\nHydrothermal carbonization (HTC) is a thermochemical process that upgrades wet agro-industrial and food waste feedstocks into a solid hydrochar with coal-like properties. Despite its ability to mitigate environmental impacts from food waste and produce bioenergy resources, HTC-based integrated biorefineries have not progressed beyond the pilot scale. Identifying favorable reaction conditions that simultaneously reduce environmental externalities and improve economic performance could enhance the commercial viability of HTC. We conduct a prospective lab-scale gate-to-gate attributional life cycle assessment of an HTC-based biorefinery based on the three largest food waste sources subject to the 2022 New York State Food Donation and Food Scraps Recycling Law. We demonstrate how HTC process variables, including feedstock and reaction conditions, affect environmental impacts. Using multiobjective systems optimization and multicriteria decision making to consider trade-offs in HTC’s functionality along with an uncertainty analysis, we find that mixing different food waste feedstocks reduces environmental impacts over any one individual food waste feedstock."

Here we use a coupled climate–energy–health model to assess the country-varying health effects of a global carbon price across nearly 30,000 future states of the world (SOWs). As a carbon price lowers fossil fuel use, our analysis suggests consistent reductions in ambient fine particulate matter (PM2.5) levels and associated mortality risks in countries that currently suffer most from air pollution. For a few less-polluted countries, however, a carbon price can increase the mortality risks under some of the considered SOWs due to emissions increases from bioenergy use and land-use changes. These potential health co-harms are largely driven in our model by the scale and method of deforestation. A robust and quantitative understanding of these distributional outcomes requires improved representations of relevant deep uncertainties, country-specific characteristics and cross-sector interactions."

We used a spatially-explicit forest simulation model (LANDIS-II) to simulate the effects of wind, management, and climate change in central Wisconsin and calculated benefits and tradeoffs among six management objectives (maximize aboveground carbon (C), soil C, harvested C, C stored in species of cultural importance to the Menominee tribe, tree diversity, and age diversity). We found that uneven-aged management achieves more ecosystem benefits (except for harvested C) than the other harvest strategies, but it was the business-as-usual harvest scenario that minimized tradeoffs among objectives. Climate change made it more difficult to store C in soils and have diverse forests and the management strategies we considered were unable to regain these lost benefits. Climate change reduced harvested C and C stored in culturally-important species, but the management strategies were able to at least partially compensate for this effect. The uncertainty surrounding the climate projections generated the largest variation in all benefits except harvested C.

    "text": "Abstract\nSimulation models of multi-sector systems are increasingly used to understand societal resilience to climate and economic shocks and change. However, multi-sector systems are also subject to numerous uncertainties that prevent the direct application of simulation models for prediction and planning, particularly when extrapolating past behavior to a nonstationary future. Recent studies have developed a combination of methods to characterize, attribute, and quantify these uncertainties for both single- and multi-sector systems. Here, we review challenges and complications to the idealized goal of fully quantifying all uncertainties in a multi-sector model and their interactions with policy design as they emerge at different stages of analysis: (a) inference and model calibration; (b) projecting future outcomes; and (c) scenario discovery and identification of risk regimes. We also identify potential methods and research opportunities to help navigate the tradeoffs inherent in uncertainty analyses for complex systems. During this discussion, we provide a classification of uncertainty types and discuss model coupling frameworks to support interdisciplinary collaboration on multi-sector dynamics (MSD) research. Finally, we conclude with recommendations for best practices to ensure that MSD research can be properly contextualized with respect to the underlying uncertainties."

This commentary lays out core definitions and concepts, identifies MSD science questions in the context of the current state of knowledge, and describes ongoing activities to expand capacities for open science, leverage revolutions in data and computing, and grow and diversify the MSD workforce. Central to our vision is the ambition of advancing the next generation of complex adaptive human-Earth systems science to better address interconnected risks, increase resilience, and improve sustainability. This will require convergent research and the integration of ideas and methods from multiple disciplines. Understanding the tradeoffs, synergies, and complexities that exist in coupled human-Earth systems is particularly important in the context of energy transitions and increased future shocks."

    "text": "Abstract\nThe social cost of methane (SC-CH4) measures the economic loss of welfare caused by emitting one tonne of methane into the atmosphere. This valuation may in turn be used in cost–benefit analyses or to inform climate policies. However, current SC-CH4 estimates have not included key scientific findings and observational constraints. Here we estimate the SC-CH4 by incorporating the recent upward revision of 25 per cent to calculations of the radiative forcing of methane, combined with calibrated reduced-form global climate models and an ensemble of integrated assessment models (IAMs). Our multi-model mean estimate for the SC-CH4 is US$933 per tonne of CH4 (5–95 per cent range, US$471–1,570 per tonne of CH4) under a high-emissions scenario (Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) 8.5), a 22 per cent decrease compared to estimates based on the climate uncertainty framework used by the US federal government. Our ninety-fifth percentile estimate is 51 per cent lower than the corresponding figure from the US framework. Under a low-emissions scenario (RCP 2.6), our multi-model mean decreases to US$710 per tonne of CH4. Tightened equilibrium climate sensitivity estimates paired with the effect of previously neglected relationships between uncertain parameters of the climate model lower these estimates. We also show that our SC-CH4 estimates are sensitive to model combinations; for example, within one IAM, different methane cycle sub-models can induce variations of approximately 20 per cent in the estimated SC-CH4. But switching IAMs can more than double the estimated SC-CH4. Extending our results to account for societal concerns about equity produces SC-CH4 estimates that differ by more than an order of magnitude between low- and high-income regions. Our central equity-weighted estimate for the USA increases to US$8,290 per tonne of CH4 whereas our estimate for sub-Saharan Africa decreases to US$134 per tonne of CH4."

The ability of BUPR to downscale population from census tracts to block groups for four states, representing a range of population densities, is evaluated here by comparing against other commonly-used ancillary datasets. The BUPR-based method outperforms all other methods in all but one state with highly-incomplete BUPR. A more detailed accuracy assessment is performed by dividing each state into low, medium, and high population density categories. The BUPR method produces more accurate downscaled population estimates for low and medium categories, though its performance deteriorates in the high density category due to its relatively coarse spatial resolution. BUPR-based dasymetric mapping is subsequently applied to the CONUS and found to generalize well beyond the four comparison states with high downscaling accuracy.

However, ABMs are often not calibrated in a formal sense. Here we examine the impact of data record size and aggregation on the calibration of an ABM for housing abandonment in the presence of flood risk. Using a perfect model experiment, we examine (i) model calibration and (ii) the ability to distinguish a model with inter-agent interactions from one without. We show how limited data sets may not adequately constrain a model with just four parameters and relatively minimal interactions. We also illustrate how limited data can be insufficient to identify the correct model structure. As a result, many ABM-based inferences and projections rely strongly on prior distributions. This emphasizes the need for utilizing independent lines of evidence to select sound and informative priors."

The U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) recommends elevating existing houses to the Base Flood Elevation (the elevation of the 100-year flood) plus a freeboard. This recommendation neglects many uncertainties. Here we analyze a case-study of riverine flood risk management using a multi-objective robust decision-making framework in the face of deep uncertainties. While the quantitative results are location-specific, the approach and overall insights are generalizable. We find strong interactions between the economic, engineering, and Earth science uncertainties, illustrating the need for expanding on previous integrated analyses to further understand the nature and strength of these connections. Considering deep uncertainties surrounding flood hazards, the discount rate, the house lifetime, and the fragility can increase the economically optimal house elevation to values well above FEMA’s recommendation."

We find that the ``conditional impact factor’’-impact factor times acceptance rate-is a suitable heuristic method for ranking journals, to strike a balance between minimizing effort objectives and maximizing citation count. Finally, we examine potential co-author tension resulting from differing rationalities by mapping out each researcher’s preferred Pareto front and identifying compromise submission strategies.

We find that the ``conditional impact factor’’-impact factor times acceptance rate-is a suitable heuristic method for ranking journals, to strike a balance between minimizing effort objectives and maximizing citation count. Finally, we examine potential co-author tension resulting from differing rationalities by mapping out each researcher’s preferred Pareto front and identifying compromise submission strategies. The explicit representation of trade-offs, especially when multiple decision-makers (co-authors) have different preferences, facilitates negotiations and can support the decision process."

    "text": "Climate change is a systems problem. Managing climate risk requires infrastructure investments aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions and adapting to changes in extreme events. These investment strategies need to account for deep uncertainty and complex dynamics across sectors and between the natural and human systems. They affect stakeholders with diverse values and preferences, and have the potential to increase equity, resilience, and justice.\nOur research group focuses on the role of environmental and socioeconomic uncertainties in shaping the efficacy of climate risk management strategies. Our interdisciplinary, mission-oriented research addresses a broad set of problems, from flood risk management to energy-system investments and draws on tools from systems engineering, decision science, data science, and economics."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Direct Normal Irradiance (DNI) is a critical component of solar irradiation for estimating Plane of Array (POA) irradiance on flat plate systems and for estimating photovoltaic and concentrating system power output. Current approaches to measuring or estimating DNI suffer from either high equipment costs or low precision and may require detailed environmental data. An alternative approach, using artificial neural networks to estimate DNI from the irradiance measurements of multiple pyranometers, is studied. We consider various neural network topologies and study the resulting errors. The neural network-based estimators are found to have higher accuracy than those obtained from empirical correlations of GHI measurements alone. Additionally, the use of a different GHI sensor than the one used to obtain the neural network training data does not induce significant errors. The ability of this method to be used as a quality-control instrument for pyrheliometer measurements is also discussed. We find that the proposed methodology is capable of detecting many instances of unreliable DNI measurements by considering the deviation between the predicted DNI and measured DNI. A more detailed analysis can be conducted by taking advantage of the data streams from the individual pyranometers."

    "section": "",
    "text": "The intermittency of solar power production is dependent on the evolution and advection of the nearby cloud field. A key problem related to solar energy integration is the improvement of 1-h-ahead forecasts to reduce the impact of intermittency on power systems operations. Many solar forecasts explicitly or implicitly assume Taylor’s hypothesis. While such advection-only forecasts can be presumed to be valid across sufficiently short time scales, it is not clear how rapidly the skill of such a forecast decays with increased lead time. As the goal is to improve the quality of 1-h-ahead forecasts, this work focuses on quantifying the skill of cloud-track wind-based cumulus-dominated cloud field forecasts with respect to lead time. No explicit connection is drawn to the quality of solar forecasts because of the importance of separating two potential sources of error: cloud field forecasting and radiative transfer estimation. It is found that the cumulus field forecast skill begins to asymptotically approach a minimum at lead times of beyond 30 min, suggesting that advection-only forecasts in a cumulus-dominated environment should not be relied upon for 1-h-ahead point forecasts used by radiative transfer methods to estimate solar power production. A first attempt at forming a probabilistic forecast that can quantify this increasing uncertainty when using advection-only methods is presented."

No explicit connection is drawn to the quality of solar forecasts because of the importance of separating two potential sources of error: cloud field forecasting and radiative transfer estimation. It is found that the cumulus field forecast skill begins to asymptotically approach a minimum at lead times of beyond 30 min, suggesting that advection-only forecasts in a cumulus-dominated environment should not be relied upon for 1-h-ahead point forecasts used by radiative transfer methods to estimate solar power production. A first attempt at forming a probabilistic forecast that can quantify this increasing uncertainty when using advection-only methods is presented."

    "text": "Abstract\nCoastal flooding drives considerable risks to many communities, but projections of future flood risks are deeply uncertain. The paucity of observations of extreme events often motivates the use of statistical approaches to model the distribution of extreme storm surge events. One key deep uncertainty that is often overlooked is model structural uncertainty. There is currently no strong consensus among experts regarding which class of statistical model to use as a ‘best practice’. Robust management of coastal flooding risks requires coastal managers to consider the distinct possibility of non-stationarity in storm surges. This increases the complexity of the potential models to use, which tends to increase the data required to constrain the model. Here, we use a Bayesian model averaging approach to analyze the balance between (i) model complexity sufficient to capture decision-relevant risks and (ii) data availability to constrain complex model structures. We characterize deep model structural uncertainty through a set of calibration experiments. Specifically, we calibrate a set of models ranging in complexity using long-term tide gauge observations from the Netherlands and the United States. We find that in both considered cases, roughly half of the model weight is associated with the non-stationary models. Our approach provides a formal framework to integrate information across model structures, in light of the potentially sizable modeling uncertainties. By combining information from multiple models, our inference sharpens for the projected storm surge 100 year return levels, and estimated return levels increase by several centimeters. We assess the impacts of data availability through a set of experiments with temporal subsets and model comparison metrics. Our analysis suggests that about 70 years of data are required to stabilize estimates of the 100 year return level, for the locations and methods considered here."

    "text": "Abstract\nCoastal planners and decision makers design risk management strategies based on hazard projections. However, projections can differ drastically. What causes this divergence and which projection(s) should a decision maker adopt to create plans and adaptation efforts for improving coastal resiliency? Using Norfolk, Virginia, as a case study, we start to address these questions by characterizing and quantifying the drivers of differences between published sea-level rise and storm surge projections, and how these differences can impact efforts to improve coastal resilience. We find that assumptions about the complex behavior of ice sheets are the primary drivers of flood hazard diversity. Adopting a single hazard projection neglects key uncertainties and can lead to overconfident projections and downwards biased hazard estimates. These results highlight key avenues to improve the usefulness of hazard projections to inform decision-making such as (i) representing complex ice sheet behavior, (ii) covering decision-relevant timescales beyond this century, (iii) resolving storm surges with a low chance of occurring (e.g., a 0.2% chance per year), (iv) considering that storm surge projections may deviate from the historical record, and (v) communicating the considerable deep uncertainty."

    "text": "Abstract\nSea levels are rising in many areas around the world, posing risks to coastal communities and infrastructures. Strategies for managing these flood risks present decision challenges that require a combination of geophysical, economic, and infrastructure models. Previous studies have broken important new ground on the considerable tensions between the costs of upgrading infrastructure and the damages that could result from extreme flood events. However, many risk-based adaptation strategies remain silent on certain potentially important uncertainties, as well as the tradeoffs between competing objectives. Here, we implement and improve on a classic decision-analytical model (Van Dantzig 1956) to: (i) capture tradeoffs across conflicting stakeholder objectives, (ii) demonstrate the consequences of structural uncertainties in the sea-level rise and storm surge models, and (iii) identify the parametric uncertainties that most strongly influence each objective using global sensitivity analysis. We find that the flood adaptation model produces potentially myopic solutions when formulated using traditional mean-centric decision theory. Moving from a single-objective problem formulation to one with multiobjective tradeoffs dramatically expands the decision space, and highlights the need for compromise solutions to address stakeholder preferences. We find deep structural uncertainties that have large effects on the model outcome, with the storm surge parameters accounting for the greatest impacts. Global sensitivity analysis effectively identifies important parameter interactions that local methods overlook, and that could have critical implications for flood adaptation strategies."

Because doing so requires running the model many times over, and because computing resources are finite, uncertainty assessment is more feasible using models that demand less computer processor time. Such models are generally simpler in the sense of being more idealized, or less realistic. So modelers face a trade-off between realism and uncertainty quantification. Seeing this trade-off for the important epistemic issue that it is requires a shift in perspective from the established simplicity literature in philosophy of science."

    "text": "Abstract\nProbabilistic projections of baseline (with no additional mitigation policies) future carbon emissions are important for sound climate risk assessments. Deep uncertainty surrounds many drivers of projected emissions. Here, we use a simple integrated assessment model, calibrated to century-scale data and expert assessments of baseline emissions, global economic growth, and population growth, to make probabilistic projections of carbon emissions through 2100. Under a variety of assumptions about fossil fuel resource levels and decarbonization rates, our projections largely agree with several emissions projections under current policy conditions. Our global sensitivity analysis identifies several key economic drivers of uncertainty in future emissions and shows important higher-level interactions between economic and technological parameters, while population uncertainties are less important. Our analysis also projects relatively low global economic growth rates over the remainder of the century. This illustrates the importance of additional research into economic growth dynamics for climate risk assessment, especially if pledged and future climate mitigation policies are weakened or have delayed implementations. These results showcase the power of using a simple, transparent, and calibrated model. While the simple model structure has several advantages, it also creates caveats for our results which are related to important areas for further research."

However, ABM simulation results can be highly sensitive to a number of modeling choices. Here, we introduce an agent-based modeling framework to explore the impact of structural versus parametric choices of household flood aversion on modeled outcomes of flood risk in a hypothetical urban environment. We deploy three structural variants of the model that fundamentally differ in the manner in which households are assumed to interface with flood hazards (disamenity, avoidance, and protection), evaluating multiple model parameterizations within each structural variant. The structural variants lead to fundamentally different conclusions regarding the evolution of flood risk, indicating that the structural choices made regarding human representation in flood risk ABMs have substantial bearing on modeling insights and ought to be elevated from an overlooked to a critical aspect of future modeling efforts."

    "text": "The variability and intermittency of renewable energy sources pose several challenges for power systems operations, including energy curtailment and price volatility. In power systems with considerable renewable sources, co-variability in renewable energy supply and electricity load can intensify these outcomes. In this study, we examine the impacts of interplay between renewable resource and load co-variability and power system constraints across multiple spatial and temporal scales. We use the New York State power system as our case study, which is undergoing a major transition toward increased renewable generation. We characterize the spatiotemporal co-variability of renewable energy-generating resources and electricity load and investigate the impact of climatic variability on electricity price volatility. We use an accurate, reduced-form representation of the New York power system, which integrates additional wind and solar power resources to meet the state’s energy targets through 2030. Our study shows while diversifying renewables mitigates power variability, short-term fluctuations can still lead to inefficient energy use and substantial curtailment. Annual electricity prices varied by 9%, with price spikes fluctuating by up to 56%, while reflecting a state-wide heterogeneity. Hydropower primarily influences yearly prices, whereas solar and wind mainly affect short-term volatility. Our results underscore the importance of considering both spatiotemporal dynamics and system constraints when planning investments in renewable energy infrastructure."

    "text": "Abstract\nDesigning strategies to manage flood risks is complicated by the often large uncertainties surrounding flood risk projections. Uncertainty surrounding riverine flood risks can stem from choices regarding boundary and initial conditions, model structures, and parameters as well as interactions among hazards, exposures, and vulnerabilities. Here we analyze a case study to rank the drivers of uncertainties surrounding riverine flood hazards and risks. Using Sobol’ sensitivity analysis with a large number of simulations, we thoroughly explore the interactions among different sources of uncertainty. We find that the projected flood risk is most sensitive to factors associated with flood hazards, rather than exposure and vulnerability: upstream discharge, river bed elevation, channel roughness, and the digital elevation model resolution. Our results highlight the importance of uncertainty quantification in enhancing the reliability of flood models and risk assessments."

Simulating housing price dynamics can enhance projections of future urban development outcomes. However, traditional hedonic regressions for housing prices, which neglect nonlinear interactions among explanatory variables, often exhibit limited predictive performance.

Interpretable ML techniques provide a promising route by combining the flexibility of ML methods with approaches to analyze the relationships between inputs and outputs. In this study, we employ interpretable ML to analyze the patterns driving the housing market in Baltimore, Maryland, USA. We train an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to predict Baltimore housing prices based on structural characteristics (e.g., home size, number of stories) and locational attributes (e.g., distance to the city center). We then conduct sensitivity and Partial Dependence Plot (PDP) analyses to interpret the fitted ANN model. We find that the ML model achieves higher predictive accuracy and explains 16 % more of housing price variance than a traditional linear regression model. The interpretable ML model also reveals more nuanced and realistic nonlinear relationships between housing sales price and predictors as well as interactive effects underlying Baltimore home price dynamics. For instance, while the linear model indicates a steady housing price increase over time, our interpretable ML model detects a post-2008 decline, with smaller properties experiencing the sharpest drop."

    "text": "Abstract\nA growing need to reduce carbon emissions has led to bold strategies like New York’s Climate Leadership and Community Protection Act, which targets a zero-emission electricity grid by 2040. However, the implications and potential vulnerabilities introduced by a zero-emission power grid in the face of changing climates and technologies have received limited scrutiny. This study addresses this gap with an energy system model that couples high spatial and temporal resolution with realistic operational constraints under diverse future climate and technology scenarios. The New York State energy system and climate-energy policy are used to examine distinct spatial and temporal vulnerabilities stemming from interactions among renewable resource availability, evolving load patterns, and major transmission congestion. Analysis indicates a need for 60%–105% additional clean-firm capacity to maintain reliability. Increasing renewable capacity alone is insufficient due to transmission constraints and variations in spatial and temporal vulnerabilities. The study offers a replicable methodology for evaluating decarbonization policies worldwide, emphasizing the importance of aligning operational realities with ambitious climate goals."

    "title": "Estimation of direct normal irradiance with multi-pyranometer arrays and artificial neural networks",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Accurate Direct Normal Irradiance measurements are important for systems that track the sun and for calculating global radiation incident on a tilted surface. One technique for measuring Direct Normal Irradiance is to use a Multi-Pyranometer Array, which uses multiple low-cost sensors rather than a single higher-cost system. However, the methods used to estimate Direct Normal Irradiance from a Multi-Pyranometer Array can be computationally intensive and rely on models developed for clear-sky conditions, rendering them less useful for real sky conditions. This thesis studies the utility of using Artificial Neural Networks as the method for estimating Direct Normal Irradiance from multiple pyranometer measurements. This has the additional benefit of being a versatile technique that could also be used with the same instrumentation to estimate other quantities of interest, such as albedo or aerosol optical depth, while also being relatively computationally efficient, or as a diagnostic tool for other systems which measure or rely on these quantities. Multiple sensor configurations are studied along with multiple network topologies. It is observed that a relatively simple network suffices for the single-site data used in this study, and the resulting estimator is found to be competitive overall with other methods of estimating Direct Normal Irradiance from pyranometer measurements."

    "text": "Accurate Direct Normal Irradiance measurements are important for systems that track the sun and for calculating global radiation incident on a tilted surface. One technique for measuring Direct Normal Irradiance is to use a Multi-Pyranometer Array, which uses multiple low-cost sensors rather than a single higher-cost system. However, the methods used to estimate Direct Normal Irradiance from a Multi-Pyranometer Array can be computationally intensive and rely on models developed for clear-sky conditions, rendering them less useful for real sky conditions. This thesis studies the utility of using Artificial Neural Networks as the method for estimating Direct Normal Irradiance from multiple pyranometer measurements. This has the additional benefit of being a versatile technique that could also be used with the same instrumentation to estimate other quantities of interest, such as albedo or aerosol optical depth, while also being relatively computationally efficient, or as a diagnostic tool for other systems which measure or rely on these quantities. Multiple sensor configurations are studied along with multiple network topologies. It is observed that a relatively simple network suffices for the single-site data used in this study, and the resulting estimator is found to be competitive overall with other methods of estimating Direct Normal Irradiance from pyranometer measurements."

    "text": "Global mean sea level rise (GMSLR) poses many climate risks, such as coastal flooding and erosion. Managing the risks associated with GMSLR can involve a balance between mitigation and adaptation, but the near-term effectiveness of CO2 emissions reductions is limited since GMSLR responds to emissions on centennial to millennial timescales. An improved understanding of relevant human-Earth interactions can provide insight into the risks associated with GMSLR and how they evolve over time. Previous studies on the interactions between uncertain emissions pathways and uncertainties in the Earth system response that result in GMSLR have been restricted to a small number of pre-defined scenarios. Here, we use a large ensemble of CO2 emissions trajectories to force a calibrated Earth system model, which simulates warming and sea level rise. Using this framework, we generate projections for radiative forcing, temperature, and GMSLR under different emissions pathways, as well as relative contributions from each component of GMSLR. We then conduct a global sensitivity analysis over uncertain emissions pathways, the carbon cycle, and climate and ice sheet dynamics. To analyze how different decarbonization strategies alter GMSLR outcomes and uncertainties, we categorize the results into different groups by emissions peaking time, which serve as a proxy for the level of mitigation ambition. From the sensitivity analysis, we find that uncertainties in emissions drive the most variance in GMSLR in the medium-to-long-term. Prior to 2070, Earth system dynamics, particularly those related to the Antarctic Ice Sheet, have the most influence on GMSLR, but between 2070 and 2100, a transition occurs as variability in emissions begins to heavily control GMSLR outcomes. We also find that GMSLR outcomes are likely to be sufficiently high to necessitate adaption regardless of when CO2 emissions peak, and even rapid mitigation cannot fully manage the risks posed by sea level rise. For the relative contributions from each component of GMSLR, there are differences depending on peaking group and timescale. Under lower-emissions pathways in the near-term, thermal expansion plays a larger role in GMSLR, but in the longer-term, the Antarctic Ice Sheet and Greenland Ice Sheet contributions dominate. Under higher-emissions pathways, the ice sheets dominate in all time periods. Both the Antarctic and Greenland Ice Sheets are also subject to the most uncertainty in future projections. Due to the large potential of the ice sheets to contribute substantially to GMSLR outcomes, characterizing the uncertainties associated with their melting is crucial to better understand future climate risks. The representation of ice sheet melting dynamics plays an important role in projecting GMSLR, and this analysis highlights the need for future studies to consider whether the simplistic melting dynamics modeled for the Greenland Ice Sheet are a suitable approximation of real-world outcomes."

    "text": "Abstract\nPeople around the world seek climate-risk information to guide their decisions. For instance, projections about future flood risk inform where households choose to live, how lenders manage credit risks, and which communities receive preference for federal funds. However, fundamental validation and verification challenges raise important concerns about the reliability of such projections. Accordingly, many promote and standardize research transparency and reusability as foundations of reliable climate-risk knowledge because they enable rigorous scrutiny of methods, development of foundational tools, and design of evaluation standards. Despite prominent success stories in the field, we find a substantial gap between principles and practice: only four percent of the most-cited peer-reviewed climate-risk studies in recent years fully share their data and code despite this being a widely accepted minimum standard for transparency. We highlight low-cost measures that researchers can immediately implement to improve transparency and reusability. Yet we recognize that transformative progress requires substantial investments, cross-sector collaboration, and careful consideration of tradeoffs, data rights, and multiple perspectives on equity. We hope this perspective accelerates both immediate actions and longer-term conversations to improve the ability of science to effectively support timely, evidence-based, and sound climate-risk management."

    "text": "Abstract\nAssessing decarbonization progress traditionally relies solely on tracking carbon emissions. Focusing on carbon emissions alone struggles to capture the complex uncertainties that may result in failing to identify early warning signals of decarbonization failures. Here we design and test an expanded indicator system that combines energy technology deployment with emissions to improve the early detection of long-term decarbonization failures. Using a large scenario ensemble simulated by a state-of-the-art multi-sectoral model for the US (GCAM-USA, N=2,304), we demonstrate that relying solely on the emissions indicator through 2035 is not adequate to skillfully predict decarbonization failures in 2050. In contrast, combining emissions with a range of technology indicators can substantially improve the predictive skill. This improvement is driven by the additional information provided by technological progress indicators, especially about the potential acceleration of long-term mitigation. For instance, indicators of technology deployment in early time periods can offer insights for the future potential of rapid deployment of carbon dioxide removal technologies, quick scale-up of renewable technologies, or accelerated phase-out of fossil fuels. Our study demonstrates the value of tracking technology indicators to better monitor decarbonization progress and offers insights for developing adaptive strategies to enhance the chances of decarbonization success."

    "text": "The relationship between the electric power system and environmental change is becoming more complex as energy systems continue to decarbonize and the broader economy is electrified. Future changes to environmental risks such as heat waves and flooding can reduce grid reliability while increasing demand. In addition to the natural variability of solar and wind resources, hydroclimatic variability may result in a weakening of hydropower as a zero-emissions generation source over decadal time scales. And California has seen blackouts resulting from attempts to manage wildfire risks by power utilities. We investigate the impact of these mechanisms under deep climate uncertainty for today’s decisions about energy system infrastructure investments. We quantify how climate variability and future climate changes impact power system reliability to understand how the power grid can be hardened to reduce outages."
