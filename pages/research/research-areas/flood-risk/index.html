<p>One near-to-medium-term effect of climate change is an increase in flooding hazard due to sea-level rise and changes in storm and precipitation patterns. 20th-century flood risk management focused on “hard” infrastructure such as levees and seawalls to control the flow of water. It is not clear that these strategies will be preferred in the future due to changes in risk from both the increased hazard and continued construction in flood-prone areas. Additionally, there are feedbacks between the human, built, and natural systems which lower the effectiveness of these measures and may perversely increase risk, particularly for the most vulnerable elements of society. We study multi-lever approaches to flood risk management, including hard infrastructure, zoning changes, and resilience-improving measures, and try to understand the magnitude and impact of feedbacks within the coupled natural-human system.</p>
