## Abstract

Flood-risk assessments inform consequential public decisions. These assessments
increasingly use large-scale building inventories that offer granular details but come with
little quality assurance. The U.S. Army Corps’ National Structure Inventory (NSI) is a
prominent example. The Corps explicitly recommends that users evaluate data quality
and adjust attributes as necessary. However, many studies skip this step. This raises
the questions: How accurate is the NSI and how do any errors influence risk
assessments and decisions? Here we use a case study for the city of Philadelphia,
Pennsylvania comparing NSI-based damage estimates against estimates with high-
quality, feature-rich local building data under an ensemble of flood scenarios. The
nearly ubiquitous practice of adopting the NSI without refinements can systematically
distort flood damage estimates with potentially drastic implications for resource
allocation decisions. Using the NSI to rank census tracts by damage – a common metric
for prioritizing federal disaster funding – generally misclassifies one-fifth of tracts
regarding their priority status. Simple refinements, such as correcting building locations,
can drastically reduce classification errors, leading to correct identification of all tracts
with respect to priority status in all but one flood scenario. Our findings demonstrate
how the use of unrefined nationwide building inventories can compromise risk
assessments and mislead resource allocation. We provide actionable guidance for
enhancing inventory reliability to improve risk estimation and decision analyses.
